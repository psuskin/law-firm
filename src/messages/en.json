For statistical evaluation and improvement of our offer, the Google Ads advertisements are evaluated using Google Conversion Tracking. For this purpose, a cookie (see section IV.) is set by Google Ads on your computer if you have reached our website via a Google advertisement. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of the Ads customer's website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. Each Ads customer receives a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked across Ads customers' websites. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Ads customers who have opted for conversion tracking. Ads customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in the tracking procedure, you can also refuse the setting of a cookie required for this - for example, by means of a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies. You can also deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser to block cookies from the domain \"www.googleadservices.com\". Google's further information and privacy policy on conversion tracking can be found here: Google Ads Help Conversion Tracking and Google Privacy Policy & Terms of Use We also use Google Tag Manager on our website. Google Tag Manager is a solution that allows marketers to manage website tags through an interface. The Tag Manager tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not collect any personal data. The tool triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, it remains in place for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager. Our website also uses Google's remarketing function. This technology serves to present interest-based advertisements to website visitors within the Google partner network. The display of advertising is carried out using cookies, with the help of which the user behavior when visiting the website can be analyzed and subsequently used for targeted product recommendations and interest-based advertising. According to Google's own statements, Google does not collect any personal data in this process. You can find further information here: Google Marketing Platform - Tag Manager Terms of Service and here Google Privacy Policy & Terms of Use If you do not want interest-based advertising via Google remarketing technology, you can deactivate the use of cookies by Google for these purposes by making the appropriate settings at the following link: Google Settings for personalized ads"
